# SYSTEM_INVENTORY.md
> Authoritative capability ledger. This is not a roadmap or config reference. 
> Inventory entries must reflect only observable artifacts in this repository: files, directories, executable code, configuration, scripts, and explicit UI text. 
>Do not include intent, design plans, or inferred behavior.

## Rules
- One component entry = one capability or feature observed in the repository.
- New capabilities go at the top under `## Inventory` and above `## Observed Initial Inventory`.
- Corrections or clarifications go only below the `## Appendix` section.
- Entries must include: 
  - Capability: **Brief Descriptive Component Name** - Date/Time
  - State: Planned, Implemented, Verified, Defferred
  - Location: `Relative File Path(s)`
  - Validation: Method &/or `Relative Script Path(s)`
  - Notes: Optional (1 line max).
  - Do not include environment values, wiring details, or implementation notes.

## States
- Planned: intent only, not implemented
- Implemented: code exists, not yet validated end-to-end
- Verified: validated with evidence (command)
- Deferred: intentionally postponed (reason noted)
