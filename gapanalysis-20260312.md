## Gap Detail

---

### G-A — Escalation Provider Execution Layer Absent

**What Project.md requires (§3.3, §6.3):**
A real escalation path to external cloud model providers when local model is unavailable, with budget governance and privacy controls applied before dispatch.

**What the repo has — correctly and completely implemented:**

- **Policy layer:** `decide_escalation()` evaluates seven gates in order: permission denied → provider not configured → provider unsupported → provider key missing → budget not allocated → budget exceeded → OK. All gates function correctly and are fully tested.
- **Settings layer:** `ALLOW_MODEL_ESCALATION`, `ESCALATION_PROVIDER`, and `ESCALATION_BUDGET_USD` are typed fields in `settings.py`, present in `.env` and `.env.example` with safe defaults, editable via `POST /settings` (first two in `EDITABLE_SETTINGS_ENV_KEYS`).
- **UI layer (`SettingsPanel.jsx`):** The escalation section is fully implemented with a save button.
  - `configuredEscalationProviders` is derived from `settings.escalation_configured_providers`, which is sourced from `ApiKeyRegistry().get_configured_providers()` — returning only providers whose `*_API_KEY` entry in `.env` is non-empty. The dropdown populates exclusively from this filtered list.
  - The dropdown is disabled when `allow_model_escalation` is unchecked or no providers are configured. A "No configured escalation providers available." message is shown when the list is empty.
  - The Save / Cancel button pair calls `updateSettings()` → `POST /settings`, which writes `ESCALATION_PROVIDER` atomically back to `.env`.
  - This behavior is confirmed by both code inspection and the screenshot provided.
- **Key registry:** `ApiKeyRegistry` reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROK_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`. Three of four have real key values present in the current `.env`.
- **Redaction:** `create_default_redactor()` is called and `redaction_result.redacted` is passed to the provider before any dispatch attempt. `escalation_redaction_applied` is set in context.
- **Controller integration:** `_handle_local_model_unavailable()` correctly calls `decide_escalation()`, sets `escalation_status` on all paths, applies redaction on the allow path, then looks up the registry.

**Status: Closed — M16 (2026-03-14)**
`backend/models/providers/` implemented with `AnthropicEscalationProvider`, `OpenAIEscalationProvider`, `GeminiEscalationProvider` (`google-genai` SDK), and `GrokEscalationProvider`. `_ESCALATION_PROVIDER_REGISTRY` populated at module load in `controller_service.py`. SDK dependencies added to `requirements.txt` (`anthropic>=0.49.0`, `google-genai>=1.0.0`, `groq>=0.22.0`). `SYSTEM_INVENTORY.md` M16 entry State: Verified. Final test baseline: `350 passed, 1 skipped`.

### G-B — Settings Panel Missing Privacy / Redaction Controls

**What Project.md requires (§3.5, §11.2):**
Settings panel includes hardware profiles, **privacy controls**, and budget monitoring.

**What the repo has:**
`SettingsPanel.jsx` `EDITABLE_FIELDS` array: `hardware_profile`, `log_level`, `allow_external_search`, `default_search_provider`, `cache_enabled`, `allow_model_escalation`, `escalation_provider`. Rendered controls cover hardware, search, cache, and escalation.

**What is missing:**
No UI controls for `REDACT_PII_QUERIES` or `REDACT_PII_RESULTS`. Both fields are defined in `settings.py` and appear in `SafeConfigProjection` and `SettingsResponse`, but are absent from `EDITABLE_FIELDS` and have no rendered control in the panel.

**Evidence:**
- `backend/config/settings.py` — `REDACT_PII_QUERIES: bool = True`, `REDACT_PII_RESULTS: bool = False`. Neither is in `EDITABLE_SETTINGS_ENV_KEYS`.
- `backend/api/schemas.py` — `SettingsResponse` includes both. `SettingsUpdateRequest` does not (no write path).
- `frontend/src/components/SettingsPanel.jsx` — `EDITABLE_FIELDS` contains no PII/redaction entries; no checkbox or control rendered for either field.

---

### G-C — No Settings API Write Path for Privacy / Redaction Fields

**What Project.md requires (§8.1):**
User controls for data handling policies including selective redaction.

**What the repo has:**
`REDACT_PII_QUERIES` and `REDACT_PII_RESULTS` are readable via `GET /settings`. The controller reads `settings.REDACT_PII_QUERIES` at runtime to gate redaction behavior.

**What is missing:**
Neither field is in `EDITABLE_SETTINGS_ENV_KEYS`. `POST /settings` raises `unsupported editable setting` for both. Values can only be changed by directly editing `.env`.

**Note:** G-B and G-C must be resolved together. The backend write path and the frontend controls are two halves of the same surface. Closing one without the other leaves an incomplete and untestable feature.

---

### G-D — Voice Stack Entirely Absent

**What Project.md requires (§2, §7):**
Whisper STT, Piper TTS, openWakeWord wake word detection, dedicated voice session workflow path, voice artifact lifecycle stored as episodic traces, deterministic voice runtime.

**What the repo has:**
- `backend/voice/__init__.py` — empty file. No imports, no code, no stubs.
- `models/models.yaml` — `whisper-stt` and `piper-tts` entries present but both `enabled: false`; no model weights exist.
- `frontend/src/components/` — no `VoicePanel.jsx` or equivalent. Components present: MemoryPanel, SettingsPanel, WorkflowVisualizer only.
- `backend/requirements.txt` — no `whisper`, `openai-whisper`, `faster-whisper`, `piper-tts`, `openwakeword`, or equivalent.
- `backend/api/main.py` — no `/voice` routes.
- `tests/` — no voice-related tests.

**Evidence:**
- `backend/voice/__init__.py`: empty (zero content).
- Repo-wide search for "whisper": no matches.
- Repo-wide search for "voice": returns only the `backend/voice` directory name — no file content matches.

**Project.md §2** marks voice as "optional" ("Voice Optional: STT/TTS and wake word, but not required for core usage"). The directory placeholder and disabled catalog stubs confirm design intent. No implementation exists anywhere.

---

### G-E — Model Integrity Checksums Absent

**What Project.md requires (§6.2, §8.2):**
"Integrity Verification: Model checksums and validation" and "Model Integrity: Checksum verification for all models."

**What the repo has:**
`models/models.yaml` entries define `path`, `download_url`, `enabled`, `roles`, `supported_hardware`, `priority`. No checksum fields of any kind (`sha256`, `md5`, `hash`, or equivalent) appear in any entry.

`model_registry.py` `ensure_model_present()` checks `path.exists()` only — no hash verification before use or after download. No verification step follows `urllib.request.urlretrieve`.

`backend/security/audit_logger.py` defines `ENCRYPTION_PERFORMED` and `DECRYPTION_PERFORMED` event types but no `MODEL_INTEGRITY_VERIFIED` or equivalent event type and no code path that would emit one.

**Evidence:**
- Repo-wide search for "checksum": no matches.
- `models/models.yaml`: no hash fields in any entry.
- `model_registry.py` `ensure_model_present()`: `path.exists()` is the sole integrity check.

**Impact:** A corrupted or substituted GGUF file is accepted silently. Real security gap, but self-contained and does not affect day-to-day functionality.

---

### G-F — Encryption at Rest Absent

**What Project.md requires (§8.1):**
"Encryption: Conversation storage encrypted at rest."

**What the repo has:**
- Task/conversation data stored as plain JSON under `data/working_state/`.
- Episodic trace stored as plain SQLite at `data/episodic/trace.db`.
- Semantic memory as plain FAISS index + SQLite at `data/semantic/`.
- `requirements.txt` includes `cryptography>=44.0.0`, `python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0`, `passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4`. These libraries are present but used for JWT handling and password hashing only — none are wired to encrypt storage artifacts.
- `backend/security/audit_logger.py` defines `ENCRYPTION_PERFORMED` / `DECRYPTION_PERFORMED` event types with no implementations that emit them.

**Evidence:**
- Repo-wide search for "encrypt": no matches.
- `memory_manager.py`: plain path strings passed to storage constructors; no encryption wrapper at any layer.
- `backend/security/`: `redactor.py`, `audit_logger.py`, `privacy_wrapper.py` — no `encryptor.py` or equivalent.

**Impact:** All local artifacts are stored in plaintext. Lowest-priority gap: the system is local-first, OS/filesystem-level encryption is the practical mitigation, and the `cryptography` library needed for implementation is already in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Gap Sequencing Rationale

**G-A (escalation provider implementations) — Closed M16.** Concrete provider classes and registry population delivered. Remaining open gaps begin at G-B.

**G-B + G-C (privacy/redaction controls)** must be closed together. The read surface for `REDACT_PII_QUERIES`/`REDACT_PII_RESULTS` already exists in the settings API response. Only the write path (`EDITABLE_SETTINGS_ENV_KEYS`) and UI controls are missing. Closes a named §3.5 requirement absent from all user-facing surfaces.

**G-D (voice stack)** is explicitly "optional" per §2 and has zero implementation. It is a large subsystem: new dependencies (Whisper, Piper, openWakeWord), new workflow nodes, new API routes, new frontend component, new tests. Lower priority than functional gaps that unblock already-built infrastructure.

**G-E (model integrity)** is self-contained. Adding `sha256` fields to `models.yaml` and a verification step to `ensure_model_present()` is a bounded, low-risk change. Real security gap but does not affect current daily functionality. Sequenced after voice, which delivers visible product capability.

**G-F (encryption at rest)** is the lowest-priority gap. OS/filesystem encryption is the practical mitigation for a personal local assistant. Wrapping all storage layers is invasive. The `cryptography` library is already in `requirements.txt` when the time comes.
