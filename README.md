JARVISv5 is the latest rewrite in a long line of rewrites.  
It currently does very little, but it does it with suspicious confidence.  
Think of it as a prototype that’s still booting up — the magic tricks come later.

### What This Is
A personal learning project where:
- the architecture is getting cleaner,
- the ideas are getting sharper,
- and the system is *slowly* becoming less of a fire hazard.

### What This Isn’t
- Finished  
- Functional  
- Reliable  
- A benchmark of anything except persistence  

### Why v5 Exists
Because v4 taught me exactly one thing:  
“I can fix this… but only if I start over again.”

### Future Plans
- Make it actually do something  
- Add features that don’t immediately collapse  
- Reduce the number of rewrites per version  
- Eventually become a usable system  

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
- **8GB+ RAM** (for local LLM inference)
- **5GB disk space** (for model files)

---

## What It Does (When Complete)

- 💬 **Chat** with local LLM via browser interface
- 💾 **Remembers** conversation history across sessions
- 📁 **Reads files** when asked (via tool execution)
- 🏠 **Runs locally** - no cloud dependencies
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** - all data stays on your machine

---

## What It Doesn't Do (Yet)

Phase 1 focuses on core functionality. 

These features are **deferred to Phase 2+**:

- Voice interface (STT/TTS)
- Web search integration
- Code execution
- Semantic memory (vector store)
- Multiple LLM models
- Cloud escalation
