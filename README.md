## Just A Rewrite, Verging Into Sorcery

JARVISv5 is the latest rewrite in a long line of rewrites.  
It currently does very little, but it does it with suspicious confidence.  
Think of it as a prototype that’s still booting up — the magic tricks come later.

### What This Is
A personal learning project where:
- the architecture is getting cleaner,
- the ideas are getting sharper,
- and the system is *slowly* becoming less of a fire hazard.

### What This Isn’t
- Finished  
- Functional  
- Reliable  
- A benchmark of anything except persistence  

### Why v5 Exists
Because v4 taught me exactly one thing:  
“I can fix this… but only if I start over again.”

### Future Plans
- Make it actually do something  
- Add features that don’t immediately collapse  
- Reduce the number of rewrites per version  
- Eventually become a usable system
