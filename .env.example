# JARVISv5 Environment Template
# Evidence-constrained to Project.md only.
# This file intentionally does not define concrete variable names/values
# because Project.md specifies configuration domains, not key schema.

# Configuration is environment-driven via `.env`.

# Configuration domains defined in Project.md:
# - hardware profiles
# - privacy levels
# - budget limits

# Operational services defined in Project.md:
# - backend
# - frontend
# - redis
# - vector store
# - validation
