# CHANGE_LOG.md
> Append-only record of reported work; corrections may be appended to entries.
> No edits/reorders/deletes of past entries. If an entry is wrong, append a corrective entry.

## Rules
- Write an entry only after task objective is “done” and supported by evidence.
- **Ordering:** Entries are maintained in **descending chronological order** (newest first, oldest last).
- **Append location:** New entries must be added **at the top of the Entries section**, directly under `## Entries`.
- Each entry must include:
  - Timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
  - Summary: 1–2 lines, past tense
  - Scope: files/areas touched
  - Evidence: exact command(s) run + a minimal excerpt pointer (or embedded excerpt ≤10 lines)
- If a change is reverted, append a new entry describing the revert and why.
